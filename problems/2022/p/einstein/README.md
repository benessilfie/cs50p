# Problem Set 0: Einstein

Even if you havenâ€™t studied physics (recently or ever!), you might have heard that $E = mc^2$, wherein $E$ represents energy (measured in Joules), $m$ represents mass (measured in kilograms), and $c$ represents the speed of light (measured approximately as 300000000 meters per second), per [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) et al. Essentially, the formula means that mass and energy are equivalent.

In a file called `einstein.py`, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent number of Joules as an integer. Assume that the user will input an integer.

## Hints

- Recall that `input` returns a `str`, per the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input)
- Recall that `int` can convert a `str` to an `int`, per the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int)
- Recall that Python comes with several built-in functions, per the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)
