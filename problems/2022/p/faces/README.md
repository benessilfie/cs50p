# Problem Set 0: Making Faces

Before there were emoji, there were [emoticons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emoticons), whereby text like `:)` was a happy face and text like `:(` was a sad face. Nowadays, programs tend to convert emoticons to emoji automatically!

In a file called `faces.py`, implement a function called `convert` that accepts a `str` as input and returns that same input with any `:)` converted to üôÇ (otherwise known as a [slightly smiling face](https://emojipedia.org/slightly-smiling-face/)) and any `:(` converted to üôÅ (otherwise known as a [slightly frowning face](https://emojipedia.org/slightly-frowning-face/))). All other text should be returned unchanged.

Then, in that same file, implement a function called `main` that prompts the user for input, calls `convert` on that input, and prints the result. You‚Äôre welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a `str` of your own as an argument to `input`. Be sure to call `main` at the bottom of your file.

## Hints

- Recall that `input` returns a `str`, per the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input)
- Recall that a `str` comes with quite a few methods, per the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods)
- An emoji is actually just a character, so you can quote it like any `str`, a la `"üòê"`. And you can copy and paste the emoji from this page into your own code as needed.
