# Problem Set 8: Cookie Jar

Suppose that you’d like to implement a [cookie jar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_jar) in which to store cookies. In a file called `jar.py`, implement a `class` called `Jar` with these methods:

- `__init__` should initialize a cookie jar with the given `capacity`, which represents the maximum number of cookies that can fit in the cookie jar. If `capacity` is not a non-negative `int`, though, `__init__` should instead raise a `ValueError`.

- `__str__` should return a `str` with $n$ `🍪`, where $n$ is the number of cookies in the cookie jar. For instance, if there are 3 cookies in the cookie jar, then `str` should return `"🍪🍪🍪"`

- `deposit` should add `n` cookies to the cookie jar. If adding that many would exceed the cookie jar’s capacity, though, `deposit` should instead raise a `ValueError`.

- `withdraw` should remove `n` cookies from the cookie jar. Nom nom nom. If there aren’t that many cookies in the cookie jar, though, `withdraw` should instead raise a `ValueError`.

- `capacity` should return the cookie jar’s capacity.

- `size` should return the number of cookies actually in the cookie jar.

Structure your `class` per the below. You may not alter these methods’ parameters, but you may add your own methods.

```python
class Jar:
    def __init__(self, capacity=12):
        ...

    def __str__(self):
        ...

    def `deposit`(self, n):
        ...

    def `withdraw`(self, n):
        ...

    @property
    def capacity(self):
        ...

    @property
    def size(self):
        ...
```

Either before or after you implement `jar.py`, additionally implement, in a file called `test_jar.py`, **four or more** functions that collectively test your implementation of `Jar` thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with `test_` so that you can execute your tests with:

```shell
pytest test_jar.py
```

Note that it’s not as easy to test instance methods as it is to test functions alone, since instance methods sometimes manipulate the same “state” (i.e., instance variables). To test one method (e.g., `withdraw`), then, you might need to call another method first (e.g., `deposit`). But the method you call first might itself not be correct!

And so programmers sometimes [mock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) (i.e., simulate) state when testing methods, as with Python’s own [mock object library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html), so that you can call just the one method but modify the underlying state first, without calling the other method to do so.

For simplicity, though, no need to mock any state. Implement your tests as you normally would!

## Hints

```python
from jar import Jar


def test_init():
    ...


def test_str():
    jar = Jar()
    assert str(jar) == ""
    jar.`deposit`(1)
    assert str(jar) == "`🍪`"
    jar.`deposit`(11)
    assert str(jar) == "`🍪``🍪``🍪``🍪``🍪``🍪``🍪``🍪``🍪``🍪``🍪``🍪`"


def test_`deposit`():
    ...


def test_`withdraw`():
    ...

```
