# Problem Set 0: Playback Speed

Some people have a habit of ~~lecturing~~ speaking rather quickly, and it’d be nice to slow them down, a la YouTube’s 0.75 playback speed, or even by having them pause between words.

In a file called `playback.py`, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with `...` (i.e., three periods).

## Hints

- Recall that `input` returns a `str`, per the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input)
- Recall that a `str` comes with quite a few methods, per the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods)
