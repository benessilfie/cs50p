When texting or tweeting, itâ€™s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter was originally called _twttr_. In a file called `twttr.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a str of text and then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.

## Hints

- Recall that a `str` comes with quite a few methods, per the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods)
- Much like a `list`, a `str` is "iterable", which means you can iterate over each of its characters in a loop. For instance, if `s` is a `str`, you could print each of its characters, one at a time, with code like:

```python
    for c in s:
        print(c, end="")
```
